# 3.007-Polywall

Project for SUTD 3.007 Design Thinking and Innovation 

The theme of the project was to increase interaction in and around Changi Business Park (CBP) in Singapore.
My group's solution was a wall that encouraged interaction : Polywall

The project information website can be found here: https://polywall.wordpress.com/

This was a ~1.5 months long final submission project.

In this project, I managed to practice the following:
1. **CAD modelling** and **inserting it into a virtual environment** using both **unreal and unity engine**.
2. **Using Codesandbox to deploy WebGL**
3. **Basics of wordpress**
4. **Basic workshop machining**
