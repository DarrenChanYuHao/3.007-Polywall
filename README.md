# 3.007-Polywall

Project for SUTD 3.007 Design Thinking and Innovation
The theme of the project was to increase interaction in and around Changi Business Park (CBP) in Singapore.
My group's solution was a wall that encouraged interaction : Polywall

The project information website can be found here: https://polywall.wordpress.com/

In this project, I managed to picked up skills such as CAD modelling and inserting it into a virtual environment using both unreal and unity engine.
I also learnt to use the basics of wordpress.
